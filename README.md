-(Java) - ComputerPartsMailingList

A Computer Mailing list using various different data structures such as maps, hashmaps and sets. Which I did to improve and expand my ability to use different data structures within Java. This system allows users to register for mailing lists and de-register from mailing lists, send and delete messages and login and register to the system with more additional functionality.
